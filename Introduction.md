# Introduction

# artificial intelligence (AI)?
Artificial intelligence is the capability of a computer system to mimic human cognitive functions such as learning and problem-solving. Through AI, a computer system uses math and logic to simulate the reasoning that people use to learn from new information and make decisions.

# What is machine learning?
Machine learning is an application of AI. It’s the process of using mathematical models of data to help a computer learn without direct instruction. This enables a computer system to continue learning and improving on its own, based on experience.
Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

# Deep Learning
One way to train a computer to mimic human reasoning is to use a neural network, which is a series of algorithms that are modeled after the human brain. The neural network helps the computer system achieve AI through deep learning

# Data Science
Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data.

There are four basic approaches:
1) supervised learning
2) unsupervised learning
3) semi-supervised learning 
4) reinforcement learning.

# Supervised Learning

supervised learning uses labeled input and output data for model training.

  1) Classification
  2) Regression
  3) Logistic Regression
  4) Naive Bayes Classifier
  5) K-NN
  6) Decision Tress
  7) Random Forest
  8) Support Vector Machine
  9) XGBoost

# UnSupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is the training of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.

Unsupervised learning model finds the hidden patterns in data. Types are Clustering & Association

  1) Hierarchical Clustering
  2) k-Means Clustering
  3) Principal Component Analysis
  4) Singular Value Decomposition
  5) Indepedent Component Analysis
  6) Market Basket Analysis
  7) Apriori Algorithm
  8) Recommender Systems

# SemiSupervised Learning

In this type of learning, the algorithm is trained upon a combination of labeled and unlabelled data. Typically, this combination will contain a very small amount of labeled data and a very large amount of unlabelled data.

The basic procedure involved is that first, the programmer will cluster similar data using an unsupervised learning algorithm and then use the existing labeled data to label the rest of the unlabelled data. 

The typical use cases of such type of algorithm have a common property among them – The acquisition of unlabelled data is relatively cheap while labeling the said data is very expensive.

# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a feedback-based Machine learning technique in which an agent learns to behave in an environment by performing the actions and seeing the results of actions. For each good action, the agent gets positive feedback, and for each bad action, the agent gets negative feedback or penalty.

In Reinforcement Learning, the agent learns automatically using feedbacks without any labeled data, unlike supervised learning.
Since there is no labeled data, so the agent is bound to learn by its experience only.
RL solves a specific type of problem where decision making is sequential, and the goal is long-term, such as game-playing, robotics, etc.

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning method where an intelligent agent (computer program) interacts with the environment and learns to act within that
